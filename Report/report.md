## Problem 
Software Engineers often face the issue of having to create and manage issues they face during development process. We have tried to harness the power of collaboration through our MasterBot which allows users to not only keep track of issues he/she is involved in but also find out issues and their users that are similar to the one he/she wants to create. Thirdly it can tell a user whether two issues are similar or not.<br>
<br>
Suppose a developer got a defect or bug while coding for which he has to raise an issue. It is inefficient to have the developer work this issue if it is very similar to one that has already been solved by someone else. The developer should have the ability to assign this new issue to the person who solved the similar issue in the past.<br>
<br>
On a similar note developers should also have the ability to look up 2 duplicate/similar issues. So that see how each was rectified.<br>

## Features

## Refelction on development proceeatures

## Limitations 

## Future work
