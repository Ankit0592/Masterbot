## Problem 
Software Engineers often face the issue of having to create and manage issues they face during development process. We have tried to harness the power of collaboration through our MasterBot which allows users to not only keep track of issues he/she is involved in but also find out issues and their users that are similar to the one he/she wants to create. Thirdly it can tell a user whether two issues are similar or not.<br>
<br>
Suppose a developer got a defect or bug while coding for which he has to raise an issue. It is inefficient to have the developer work this issue if it is very similar to one that has already been solved by someone else. The developer should have the ability to assign this new issue to the person who solved the similar issue in the past as he can solve it much faster due to his prior experience. So rather than fixing the new issue our developer can get back to doing more productive things. This saves hours and therefore money for the team.<br>
<br>
On a similar note developers should also have the ability to look up two duplicate/similar issues. So that see how each was rectified.<br>
<br>
Also when two or more members are working on the same issue and when one assignee changes the status of the issue, all other assignees should get a notification alerting them the change in status. This happens instantly and so the user does not need to keep checking back on the issue to find its status. Even emails take time to be triggered. <br>
<br>

## Features
1. MasterBot provides suggestions on who can be assigned a new issue being created based on similarity with past issues and then creates the issue on Jira assigning it to the member chosen. It ensures that the task gets assigned to a person who has already worked on similar tasks and expedites the development process. 
<br>
2. MasterBot also notifies assignees of the change of state of a task on JIRA(In Progress, Completed etc.) which is useful when different team members are working on subtasks within a task and their tasks have dependency on each other.
<br>
3. MasterBot can also pull up issues from Jira that it thinks are similar to the one provided to it
