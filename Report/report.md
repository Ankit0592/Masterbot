## Problem 
During development, software engineers often face the problem of having to create and manage issues/tasks. We have tried to harness the power of collaboration through our MasterBot which allows users to not only keep track of issues they are involved in but also find out users who have worked on similar issues to make the process of issue creation and assignment smarter. Thirdly, it can also tell a user whether duplicates of an issue exist or not.<br>
<br>
Suppose a developer gets a defect or bug while coding for which he has to raise an issue. It is inefficient to have the developer work on this issue if it is very similar to one that has already been solved by someone else. The developer should have the ability to assign this new issue to the person who solved the similar issue in the past as he can solve it much faster due to his prior experience. So rather than fixing the new issue our developer can get back to doing more productive things. This saves hours and therefore money for the team.<br>
<br>
On a similar note, developers and testers should also have the ability to look up duplicate issues. This helps in reducing redundancies in the issues tracked in a system(Jira) which may otherwise reduce the team's productivity. <br>
<br>
Also, when two or more members are working on the same issue and when one assignee changes the status of the issue, all other assignees should get a notification alerting them the change in status. Emails, Email notifications and scrums are a cumbersome way to keep track of such assigned issues. They also take time to be triggered. A direct message should be triggered to all relevant user. This should happen instantly so the user does not need to keep checking back on the issue/emails to find its status. <br>
<br>

## Features
1. **Confusion in determining right team member to assign bugs**- MasterBot provides suggestions on who can be assigned a new issue being created based on similarity with past issues and then creates the issue on Jira assigning it to the member chosen. It ensures that the task gets assigned to a person who has already worked on similar tasks and expedites the development process. <br>
A. User enters ‘Create MAS’ to the bot. (MAS is the currently hosted project ID)<br>
B. User then enters issue type. (1 for Bug, 2 for Task, 3 for Exit)<br>
C. User then enters summary like 'Lazy loading on profile page not working'.<br>
D. Bot then provides a list users who have worked on similar issues. <br>
E. Click on a user for the newly created issue to be assigned to the selected user. A new issue will be created and assigned to the selected user. <br>

2. **Slippage of relevant notifications** - MasterBot also notifies assignees of the change of state of a task on JIRA(In Progress, Completed etc.) which is useful when different team members are working on subtasks within a task and their tasks have dependency on each other. It sends push notifications as direct message/s to the relevant assignee/s of a task.<br>
A. Login as apshukla on JIRA<br>
B. Login as aarora6 on Slack. <br>
C. Visit [MAS-1](https://masterbot.atlassian.net/browse/MAS-88)<br>
D. Change status from 'In Progress' to 'Done'<br>
E. Since aarora6 is assigned to the subtask under the above referenced issue he will get a notification on slack. <br>

3. **Redundant issue/bugs** - MasterBot can reduce the number of redundant issues in the system by pulling up issues from Jira that it thinks are duplicate to the one provided to it. <br>
 A. User (either of TA1 or TA2) enters ‘Duplicate MAS-77’ as a message to the bot on slack. (MAS is the currently hosted project ID)<br>
   B. Bot provides issues which is/are suspected duplicate(s) of [MAS-77](https://masterbot.atlassian.net/browse/MAS-77). The duplicates reported are [MAS-76](https://masterbot.atlassian.net/browse/MAS-76) <br>

## Reflection on development procedures
While working on this project we got a good hands-on experience with the various stages in the SDLC and it is something we will take with us as we move into the industry. In the very first milestone we understood how valualbe pictorial representation can be as we were making our StoryBoard. While working on the second milestone, we learned the importance of Selenium testing and mocking for testing an under-development application. During the third and fourth milestone, we got a good understanding of technologies like Ansible, AWS Lambda functions, EC2 instances, Node.js, Jira APIs, etc. For each phase of development we first got into a brainstorming session to decide how to proceed and then divided the tasks amongst ourselves. Right from the start an Agile method of development kept us on our toes and we were able to make key transitions and modifications in the design and implementation of our project through it. We kept track of the progress of each of our tasks through our worksheets on Trello boards. Regular scrums let us know where each member was with regards to his/her work. Each of us took ownership of different aspects of software engineering process, and this allowed us to keep on top of our objectives in a timely manner. Overall, it was a challenging yet a fulfilling experience, and we feel a sense of accomplishment in being able to deliver the project successfully.

## Limitations 
1. In our current implementation there will be a lookup to Jira every time we wish to asign a new issue to some user. So a project with a large number of issues will be very slow as the issue to be created will have to be matched with all of those past issues. So in its current model our MasterBot will not scale up well with larger projects.<br>
2. Secondly, the text matching algorithm extracts words from issue summary and uses them as labels for the particular issue. Therefore, the length of an issue's summary will have a large bearing on it being matched to other issues. Long summaries will have more labels making it more likely to be matched with past issues.<br>
3. Also, for the first use case, our code fetches labels from issues that are already existing and uses these labels for matching with labels extracted from the given summary. So in case an issue was created directly on Jira, and no labels were assigned to it, it will be missed in our lookup. The solution is to apply the label extraction logic on the summaries of all issues fetched from Jira (who do not have labels), but this will be time consuming.<br>
4. Currently, MasterBot only matches duplicate issues based on the similarity of their summary/title.<br>

## Future work
1. There could be an index of issues and their respective assignees pertaining to a particular module that will be referenced if a new issue is being created for that module.
2. Automatic jobs can be run to report duplicate issues in the system thereby getting rid of developers spending time on matching pairs of issues manually.
3. When a new issue is being created, at that moment only it can be matched with other issues in the system to ascertain whether the issue being created is a duplicate of another, though matching in large projects may take time.
